in order to detect if power is on, i could make a quick liitle atmega project with serial interface.  the atmega power would come from the wall wart and then there

OK probably want two network interfaces: the USB one and the ethernet.  have these both configured, use the USB one primarily.  if a ping can't get through the USB, restart the 
USB interface, switch over to ethernet if possible, and try again to 

might want a separate thread that accepts texts and returns to you the status of the temperature and power



   
import time

State = "OK"
#other values for State are "PROBLEM_TEMPERATURE", "PROBLEM_POWER", "PROBLEM_TEMPERATURE_AND_POWER"

TemperatureThreshold = 80.0

while(True):
      
      time.sleep(1)
      
      #check that we are connected to the internet, use USB modem as default, switch to ethernet if USB goes out
      
      #get the cryo temperature
      
      #check if there is wall power
      
      # form the text message and send it out if necessary
